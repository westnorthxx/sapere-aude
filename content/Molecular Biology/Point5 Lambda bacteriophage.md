- get familiar with the figure below ASAP

- ci=λ repressor
- P~L~ P~R~ : lytic (strong promoter)
- P~RM~: lysogenic (weak promoter) P~RE~：weak
- 3 operons from right to left (overlapping with two promoters: P~RM~ & P~R~)
	- O~R1~: ci (lambda repressor binding site)
	- O~R2~：cro binding site
	- O~R3~：for both, lower affinity
- positive feedback: cro/ci binds with the operon on the opposite site respectively
- Cro is a repressor, but lambda repressor (ci) is not only a repressor
- N：anti-termination 
- ci
	- 四聚体
- P~RE~(repression establish):
	- weak promoter
	- makes antisense cro
- cII: orc
